# BSQ
My BSQ Is Faster Than Yours


### What is BSQ

BSQ is our final project of the 2017 "Piscine" of the french coding school named "42". The "Pisicine" is a month where we've been working between 15/21 hours a day. During this "Piscine", we were taught Unix and C languages.

BSQ is a file parser, our program will receive one or more files, which are maps, in these maps, you will have to find the biggest square. We made our best so our BSQ can go as quick as possible, and use less memory as possible.

## Running the tests

Our project mark is : 100 / 100 |
We have be doing a lot of tests, it never fail.
We've also been testing it against a lot of other bsq, our never lost :) .

If you want to test our project, you just have to

```
./bsq [Name of my map] [More names feel free to add as much as you want?]
```

### And coding style tests

Explain what these tests test and why
